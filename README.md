# Multilayer Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network from scratch

The point of this project was to understand _multilayer ANNs_ by building one from scratch.
The network uses sigmoid as activation function and is capable of visualizing what each neuron is "looking for" when applied to 2D clasification problems.
